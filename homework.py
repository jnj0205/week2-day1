#Exercise #1
#Cube Number Test... Print out all cubed numbers up to the total value 1000#
#. Meaning that if the cubed number is over 1000 break the loop.#

list=[1,1000]

for i in range(1,1001):
    cube = i**3
    list.append(cube)
    print(cube)
if cube == 1000:
    break

print(list)


#Get first prime numbers up to 100#
prime_num = list(1,100)

for num in prime_num:
    if num ==2
    print(num)
    if num % != 2
    if num % ==5
    print(num)
    if num % 5


###Take in a users input for their age, if they are younger
#  than 18 print kids, if they're 18 to 65 print adults, 
# else print seniors. Gracefully log the error if the user doesn't enter 
# a number###

age=int(age)
    if age is <= 18
        print(kids)
    if age is <=65
        print(adults)
    else:
        print(seniors)

print()
